# Java Projects
These are different Java projects that been made throughout the past four years. Each one deals with a different subject matter. In the case of the Binary project, this project is essentially a binary converter that converts different kinds of decimals to binary and vice versa. It also converts from hexadecimal to binary or hexadecimal to decimal. 

In the case of DCLL, this project focuses on creating what's called a Doubly Circular Linked List. DCLL is a LinkedList that has references both forwards and backwards not only for all the middle nodes but also for the node at the top of the linked list (head) but also at the end of the linked list (tail). 

The last two recently added projects are knapsack solver (different knapsack approaches to solving different knapsack problems) and a SAT solver (specifically 3SAT. This class contains different SAT approaches to solving different 3SAT problems).
